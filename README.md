# Flight Fare Prediction

## Project Description

The Flight Fare Prediction project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the fares of airline flights based on various factors such as departure date, time, route, stops, and additional services. This project aims to provide users with an estimate of flight prices, helping them to make more informed decisions when booking flights. By analyzing historical flight data, the model can predict future flight prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

## Data Gathering

The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It can be accessed and downloaded from the following link: [Flight Fare Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh).

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project comprises historical flight data, including features like:

- **Airline**: The name of the airline.
- **Date of Journey**: The date of the flight.
- **Source**: The starting point of the journey.
- **Destination**: The endpoint of the journey.
- **Route**: The route taken by the flight.
- **Dep_Time**: The time when the flight departs.
- **Arrival_Time**: The time when the flight arrives.
- **Duration**: Total duration of the flight.
- **Total_Stops**: Total stops between the source and destination.
- **Additional_Info**: Additional information about the flight.
- **Price**: The price of the flight ticket.

This data is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## How This Project Works

The Flight Fare Prediction project works by following these steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparing the data for training, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features that influence flight prices.
- **Model Training**: Using the processed data to train a machine learning model. Various algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression can be explored to find the best performer.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RÂ² score.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict flight fares based on user input.
